The National SID Foundation (My First Original Song)

The National SID Foundation is proud to commend Sonya Rowe,
For being an idiot station, and having no brains that we know.

The National CRID Foundation (My Sister's Parody of My First Original Song)

The National CRID Foundation is proud to commend Chris Rowe,
For being an idiot station, and having no brains that we know.

Meaning: SID stands for "Sonya is Dumb", and CRID stands for Christopher is Dumb.
It is absurd to think there would be a country-level organization dedicated to the stupidity of a specific person.
This is purely an insult song, and did frequently provoke when I sang it in the presence of my sister.
As noted elsewhere (e.g. the meaning explanation for "Sonya's Dumb"), the target of the song 
is actually of normal to slightly above average intelligence. Occasionally my sister would
sing her version of it, changin the target to me, kind of parodying my insult song in the reverse direction
 
I was generally okay with the reversal, acknowledging that turnabout is fair play, so the reversal
did not generally provoke a reaction. This meant the main song was sung far more often than the parody,
an example of the principle that life is not fair.
