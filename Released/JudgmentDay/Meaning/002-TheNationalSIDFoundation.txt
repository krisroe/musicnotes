The National SID Foundation (Original Song)

The National SID Foundation is proud to commend Sonya Rowe.
For being an idiot station, and having no brains that we know.

Meaning: SID stands for "Sonya is Dumb". It is absurd to think there would be a country-level organization
dedicated to the stupidity of a specific person. This is purely an insult song, and did frequently provoke
a reaction. As noted elsewhere (most notably in the explanation for "Sonya's Dumb"), the target of the song 
is actually of normal to slightly above average intelligence. Occasionally the target of the song would sing it 
with altered lyrics, specifically reversing to "The National CRID Foundation is proud to commend Chris Rowe". 
The original creator of the song was generally okay with the reversal, acknowledging that turnabout is fair play. 
But the lack of reaction for the reversal meant the main song was sung far more often than the reversal, an
example of the principle that life is not fair.
