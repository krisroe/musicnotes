Sweetly Sings the Donkey at the Break of Day (Children's Song)

Sweetly sings the donkey at the break of day.
If you do not feed him, this is what he'll say:
"Hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw, hee-haw."

This song can be sung as a three part round, as the lines of the piece are equal length and compatible with being a round.

Meaning: The song describes the morning routine of a donkey. The donkey sings at daybreak, which is curious because donkeys
do not "sing" the way humans do, and also the noises a donkey makes are not particularly analogous to singing to human ears. 
The donkey is fed in the morning as typical for farm animals. And if not fed the hungry donkey will say donkey sounds. Again, 
this is curious because donkeys do not "say" things the way humans do. Nevertheless the donkey says "Hee-haw" five times. 
What does the donkey mean by its singing and saying? The obvious answer of saying "Feed me" or "Please feed me" is a reasonable 
choice of ascribing human words to the donkey. But we can never really know if that's correct or if the donkey's singing/saying
has another more inscrutable meaning.
