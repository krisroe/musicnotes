[My sister at ~12 years old]
[Me at ~14 years old]

[start answering machine message]

[my sister and me sing, to the tune of (Row,row,row your Boat)]
Rowe, Rowe, Rowe household,
that is who you've reached.
We're not here right now so leave us a message
right after the beep.

[pause a few seconds]

My sister: Where's the beep?

[pause a couple seconds]

Me: It's gotta be around here someplace.

[end answering machine message]

(Listener now hears the answering machine beep and can leave their message)
