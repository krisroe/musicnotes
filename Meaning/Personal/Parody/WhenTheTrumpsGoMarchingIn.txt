When the Trumps Go Marching In/Out
(Tune of When the Saints Go Marching In (Negro Spiritual))

Oh, when the Trumps...
Go Matching In/Out...
Oh, when the Trumps Go Marching In/Out...
Oh, how I want to be in that Number...
Oh, when the Trumps Go Marching In/Out...

Meaning: This song marks the transition point for Donald Trump and his family to move in or out
of the White House as part of a change in presidential administration. Each presidential
administration has a start and an end, and since Trump was elected to non-consecutive terms,
he has more transition points than other presidents (other than long-past Grover Cleveland).

The primary humor here is the tie of sainthood from the original song, to Donald Trump,
who based on public communication, hearsay, and common knowledge of personality is no saint.
Some people even consider him as evil, but not everyone agrees (including me), and most 
supporters would disagree vehemently.

The difficult part to interpret is the desire to be with the Trumps as they go in or out.
My guess is many people recoil from this type of narcissistic personality, even moreso 
with familiarity. But there are human psychological mechanisms that allow the charismatic to
obtain followers. Even so, I feel unsatisfied with understanding this at a mere psychological
level, a strange curiosity as to the nuts and bolts of how such a person achieves that
level of power. But as this knowledge is clearly denied to me on a personal level, 
all I can do is sing this song and its four transition points across two presidential
administrations, marking my ignorance as to the details of why/how the Trumps are marching
in or out.
