Sonya's Dumb (Parody of Rain, Rain, go Away)

Sonya's dumb
She's a bum
She is a dirty trum
Ha ha ha
She's some fa
She gets sent to la la la

The song is insulting the sibling (Sonya) for being dumb, and the singer finds this funny (ha ha ha). There is no
particular meaning ascribed to bum other than it rhymes with dumb. "Trum", "fa", and "la la la" are nonsense
filler. Although the singer's analytical skills are significantly beyond the sibling's, as humans go the sibling
was actually normal to a bit above normal intelligence.
