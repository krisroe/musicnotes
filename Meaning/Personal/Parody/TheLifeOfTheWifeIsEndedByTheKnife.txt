The Life of The Wife is Ended by the Knife (Family Guy)

Not much of a parody here, just sing it solo and more coherent than in the televation show. There aren't any
meaning changes to speak of.

(Start Song)

The life of the wife is ended by the knife!
The life of the wife is ended by the knife!
[with emphasis] The wife! The wife!
[with more emphasis] The knife! The knife!
The life of the wife is ended by the knife!
