Let it Go (Semi-Parody-Song). From YouTube video eymtTwRoFFU.

I replace the word "cold" with "code" in both spots, making it "The code never bothered me anyway."

Is this enough to make it a parody song? If you have a cold, saying "cold" can come out as "code". If I have a superpower, 
it probably has something to do with writing code  (I am a coder and like to think of myself as having decent skillz), 
so I think it works in that respect. Although it also doesn't work because I don't publicly conceal my ability to code 
(unlike Elsa's ice powers). And I do think about code ALL THE TIME and if I'm not paying attention that might be why.
