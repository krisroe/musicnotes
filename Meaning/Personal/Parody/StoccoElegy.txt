Elegy to Stocco (created while taking care of my dying mother). Sung to the tune of Cat's Cradle.
Stocco died around Christmas in the winter, so he couldn't be buried in the pet graveyard immediately.

I petted a cat, the other day.
His name was Stocco and he liked to play.
He was named for a quarterback of his day. (John Stocco, University of Wisconsin quarter back, and later Indianapolis Colts backup)
If asked to use the litter box, he'd say no way. (he wasn't fully house trained)
I thought he was immortal, but that wasn't true. (he lived a long time, and my mother and I both had issues with immortality)
Oh, Stocco, it was nice knowing you, cat.
Oh, Stocco, we loved you.
And the cat was in the freezer with the chili and soup. (his corpse was left in the freezer until spring so we could bury him)
I buried him later with the rest of the troupe. (the other pets my mother had had custody of when they died)
Good-bye Stocco, I'm sorry you died.
We'll see you on the other side, cat.
We'll see you on the other side.

Emotion: sad
