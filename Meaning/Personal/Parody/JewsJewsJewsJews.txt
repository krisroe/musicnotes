Jews Jews Jews Jews (to the tune of Vengaboys Boom Boom Boom Boom refrain)

[preferably sung in faux Hitler accent]

Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!
I want to kill the Jews!
And kill them all together!
There'll be no Jews forever!
Jews! Jews! Jews! Jews!
I want to kill them soon!
And so that there will never
Be Jews in any room!

Not super proud of this one, but it exists. I suppose this is a strange attempt to peer into the mindset of those that perpetrated or participated in the 
Holocaust or other pograms against Jews. I don't feel I have any understanding of why people would do that, even with an understanding of the psychological
mechanisms involved. Making the idea into a catchy song seems irrational enough to me to make consistent nonsense. Not sure what any actual Jews would 
think of this, I don't really know any Jewish people, but I'm not really broadcasting this beyond being part of this song repository.
