Phantom of the Opera (solo, same melody)

In sleep, I sang to me, in dreams I came, that voice which calls to me, and speaks my name.
And do I dream again? for now I find the phantom of the opera is here, inside my mind.

Sing once again with me, our strange duet; my power over me grows stronger yet,
And though I turn from me, to glance behind, the phantom of the opera is here, inside my mind.

Those who have seen my face, draw back in fear. I am the mask I wear, it's me they hear.
My spirit and my voice, in one combined; the phantom of the opera is here, inside my mind,

The phantom of the opera!
Beware the phantom of the opera!

In all my fantasies, I always knew that man and mystery were both in two,
And in this labyrinth where night is blind, the phantom of the opera is here, inside my mind,
The phantom of the opera!
I'm there, the phantom of the opera!

Ah!
Ah! Ah!
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

Meaning:

I sing this as a solo, which makes for a strange song as the original song is a duet. Second person pronouns become first
person. I dedicate this to Anthony Tong, who shot four coworkers in an active shooter incident and then committed suicide-by-cop.
I used this song to try to understand what was going on in my mind, and also in myself as recovery for psychological trauma
related to the same incident.
