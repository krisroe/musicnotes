Awesome God (My Contrafactum)

When he rolls up his sleeve, he ain't just puttin' on the Ritz,
My God is an awesome God.
There is thunder in his footsteps and lightning in his fist,
My God is an awesome God.
No, the Lord he wasn't jokin' when he kicked 'em out of Eden.
It weren't for no reason that he shed his blood.
His return is very close and so you'd better be believin' that
My God is an awesome God.

My God is an awesome God,
He reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
My God is an awesome God.

My Dog is an awesome Dog,
It rains from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
My Dog is an awesome Dog.

And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,
Our God is an awesome God.
He spoke into the darkness and created the light.
Our God is an awesome God.
His judgment and wrap, he poured out on Sodom,
His mercy and grace, he gave us at the cross.
I hope we can change whenever we've forgotten that our God is an awesome God.

Our God is an awesome God,
It reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
Our God is an awesome God.

Our God is an awesome God,
Xe reigns from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
Our God is an awesome God.

(Our God) My God is an awesome God,
He reigns (He reigns) from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
My God is an awesome God.
(My God) Our God is an awesome God,
He reigns (She reigns) from heaven above
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
Our God is an awesome God.
My God is an awesome God.
Our God is an awesome God.
