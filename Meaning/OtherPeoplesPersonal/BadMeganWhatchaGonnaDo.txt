Bad Megan (My 8th Grade Teacher's Contrafactum of Bad Boys by the Jamaican group Inner Circle)

(Start Song)

Bad Megan, bad Megan.
Whatcha gonna do?
Whatcha gonna do when report cards come out?

[potentially repeated]

(End Song)

Meaning: This contrafactum comes from one of my 8th grade teachers. There was a girl in the class named Megan. I don't remember exactly why, I assume Megan did poorly on some assignment, and the teacher sang in class a brief song reminding her of the potential consequence. It was an obvious parody/contrafactum of "Bad Boys" which was the theme song for COPS, substituting Megan's name for "Boys". For the consequences, "when they come for you" was replaced with "when report cards come out", indicating her parents wouldn't be happy with her grades. I remember Megan as an average student and didn't know her very well. One interesting twist in this story is that Megan had the richest parents in the class (owning a local waterpark). I have no idea what expectations were placed on her in that position, maybe the song was sung because the teacher had an inkling of the potential consequences based on her parent/teacher conference history. Also I might not have remembered the song had it been about anyone else. Megan disappeared from my life after 8th grade, my understanding was she went to a private expensive high school in Pennsylvania instead of continuing with our class. But the song is significant enough to me to warrant discussion of its meaning.
