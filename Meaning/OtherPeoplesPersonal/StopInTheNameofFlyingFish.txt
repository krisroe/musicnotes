Stop in the Name of Flying Fish (My Classmate's Parody of the Supreme's "Stop in the Name of Love")

(Start Song)

Stop in the Name of Flying Fish and Read my Report

(End Song)

This parody song was a 5th grade project whose subject was flying fish. I don't remember any other details, but the project was physically placed in the 5th grade classroom with other projects of the kind. The project in question contained a large poster with a picture of flying fish and the text: "Stop in the Name of Flying Fish and Read my Report". This is an obvious parody of the Supreme's "Stop in the Name of Love" whose purpose is to draw attention to the project. It wasn't my project (it was a female classmate of mine), but I thought the song parody was clever and I personally put a tune to the parody song, so it is possible to sing it. I don't know if she knew she had created a parody song, or if she even had her own tune to go with it. But together we've created something that lasts in my memory at least.
