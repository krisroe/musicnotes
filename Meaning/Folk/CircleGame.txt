The Circle Game (Joni Mitchell)

And the seasons, they go round and round.
And the painted ponies go up and down.
We're captive on a carousel of time.
We can't return, we can only look behind from where/whence we came.
And go round and round and round in the Circle Game.

(Begin Song)

Yesterday a child came out to wonder.
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar.
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder.
And tearful at the falling of a star.

[Refrain]

Then the child made ten times round the seasons.
Skated over ten clear frozen streams.
Words like, "When you're older" must appease him.
And promises that some day make his dreams.

[Refrain]

Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now.
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town.
And they'll tell him, "take you're time it won't be long now...
'til you drag your feet to slow the circles down."

[Refrain]

So the years spin by, and now our boy is twenty.
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true.
They'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty.
Before the last revolving year is through.

[Refrain]

And go round, and round, and round in the Circle Game.

(End Song)

The seasons turn every year. We pass milestones in our lives, leaving the innocence of childhood, entering the threshold
of adulthood, and finally reaching adulthood. Time doesn't go backward, so we can only look behind at our successes and failures.

Emotion: Mostly sad, perhaps with a touch of hope
