You are My Sunshine (Jimmie Davis and Charlie Mitchell). Johnny Cash covered it (among many others).

[Refrain]
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine.
You make me happy, when skies are grey.
You'll never know, dear, how much I love you.
Please don't take my sunshine away.

(Begin Song)

The other night, dear, as I lay sleeping,
I dreamt I held you in my arms.
When I awoke, dear, I was mistaken, and I bowed/hung my head and cried.

[Refrain]

I'll always love you and make you happy if you would only say the same,
but if you leave me to love another, you'll regret it all someday.

[Refrain]

You told me once, dear, you really loved me, and no one else could come between.
But now you've left me to love another. You have shattered all my dreams.

[Refrain]

(End Song)
