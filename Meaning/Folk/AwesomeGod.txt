Awesome God (Rich Mullins). musicnotes.com MN0041001.

[Refrain]
Our God is an awesome God;
He reigns from heaven above.
With wisdom, pow'r and love,
Our God is an awesome God!

(Start Song)

When He rolls up His sleeve, He ain't just "puttin' on the Ritz."
Our God is an awesome God!
There is thunder in His footsteps and lightnin' in His fist.
Our God is an awesome God!
And the Lord wasn't jokin' when He kicked 'em out of Eden;
it wasn't for no reason that He shed His blood.
His return is very close and so you better be believin' that
Our God is an awesome God!

[Refrain]
[Refrain]

And when the sky was starless in the void of the night,
Our God is an awesome God!
He spoke into the darkness and created the light.
Our God is an awesome God!
The judgment and wrath He poured out on Sodom,
The mercy and grace He gave us at the cross.
I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten that
Our God is an awesome God!

(End Song)

Meaning: This song pays homage to the awesomeness of the Christian God. Awesomeness could mean a feeling of awe when presented by God or a less divine meaning of really impressive, either way it works. In the song, "God" refers both to "God the Father" (typically thought of as beyond human) and "God the Son" (Jesus Christ, both God and human). The main refrain "Our God is an awesome God!" does not distinguish between the two. The main refrain also indicates God is shared between the singer and the listener so the target audience is Christians.

"Rolling up one's sleeve" is an idiom meaning preparing to do a difficult task. A sleeve is also part of a garment a human would wear so from the start it is personifying God. "Putting on the Ritz" is an idiom meaning dressing fancy. So whatever the song says God has done or will do is hard work and not doing it for show. Footstep-based thunder and fist-based lightning both reference God's powers (to make storms happen) to do work with human hands. Weather control is more a God the Father thing so the lyric is hinting at both personas of God taking on human traits.

The song describes several of God's past accomplishments - some attributed to the Father and others the Son:
The Father:
1. Creating light where once was only darkness in Creation
2. Casting Adam and Eve out of the Garden of Eden following original sin
3. Destroyed Sodom and Gomorrah after judging their extreme sin
The Son:
1. Jesus suffered and died on the cross, shedding his blood, as the price to atone for the sins of humanity, exposing humans to God's mercy and grace.

The song says all of these actions have serious purpose. The singer then says "I hope that we have not too quickly forgotten" [God's awesomeness]. These actions took place long ago, with the Father's actions in time immemorial, and the sons actions taking place thousands of years ago at the start of the Anno Domini age. With so many generations passing, the memory has faded, but God could do something awesomely new, and humans would be wise to keep the possibility in mind to better cope with what could happen.

And there is the warning of "His return is very close". The most natural reading is this refers to the second coming of Christ. But the song personifies them both, so it could refer to a human return of the Father or the Son or both.

The one thing the song suggests humans need to do is: "You'd better be believing that God is an awesome God". So even if you don't believe anything really dramatic will actually happen, believing in the awesome potential power of God might be enough to get by.
