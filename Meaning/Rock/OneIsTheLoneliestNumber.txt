One is the Loneliest Number (Three Dog Night, cover of Harry Nilsson version)

One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.
Two can be as bad as one, it's the loneliest number since the number one.

'No' is the saddest experience you'll ever know.
Yes, it's the saddest experience you'll ever know.
'Cause one is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.
One is the loneliest number, oo, worse than two.

It's just no good anymore since you went away.
Now I spend my time, just making rhymes of yesterday.
One is the loneliest number.
One is the loneliest number.
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.

One is the loneliest.
One is the loneliest.
One is the loneliest number that you'll ever do.

Meaning: The song reduces a person's romantic relationship status to a single number. One means being alone. Two means being in a relationship. These reductions allow for clever commentary on relationships. No person comes into the world in a romantic relationship so all people have experience with being without one. Not all relations are healthy, so it's possible having a relationship is just as bad as not being in one. Asking someone to be in a romantic relationship and hearing "No" is a sad experience, with the song claiming it's the saddest experience knowable. The song states the general rule is not being in a relationship is worse than being in one, although the human experience is a significant fraction of people prefer being alone.

The most interesting lyric is "Yes, it's the saddest experience that you'll ever know." It's curious because linguistically it's ambiguous between the "Yes" meaning being told "Yes, I will be in a relationship with you" and yes merely being an extra assent to bolster the preceding line "'No', it's the saddest experience that you'll ever know." The obvious interpretation is it's just bolstering the previous statement. The first meaning could logically work, as the song has already pointed out that two can be just as bad as one. But it doesn't work since it's contradictory: both "No" and "Yes" can't both be the saddest experience you'll ever know at the same time.

Most of the song is philosophical commentary (especially repeated incantation of "One is the loneliest number"). But the lines "It's just no good anymore since you went away." and "Now I spend my time, just making rhymes of yesterday." are anchored in the singer's experience. The singer in the song just ended a relationship, and is now lonelier. The singer in the song is taking it hard, spending time making poetry from the past, remembering the relationship now gone. So the song can have meaning to a listener with painful breakups in the past.

One curious detail about the song is the Three Dog Night version of the song has three singers, so to assign the number for the band gives three. Another thing to note is in the Harry Nilsson version of the song, there is only one singer, so maybe it's a one. Does "three" have the knowledge or the right to comment on "one" and "two"? Or does the "one" version better know the meaning of "one"? The songs are very similar and are getting at the same ideas. But the "three" version ended up more popular than the "one" version, so the "one" version of this song ended up as the loneliest version.
