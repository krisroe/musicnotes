All Star (Smash Mouth)
Released: 1999-05-04

Somebody once told me the world is gonna roll me.
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed.
She was lookin' kind of dumb with her finger and her thumb
in the shape of an "L" on her forehead.

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'.
Fed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'.
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

So much to do, so much to see.
So what's wrong with takin' the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go.
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold.
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

It's a cool place, and they say it gets colder.
You're bundled up now, wait 'til you get older.
But the media man beg to differ.
Judging by the hole in the satellite picture.
The ice we skate is gettin' pretty thin.
The water's gettin' warm, so you might as well swim.
My world's on fire, how 'bout yours?
That's the way I like it and I never get bored.

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
All that glitters is gold.
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
All that glitters is gold.
Only shootin' stars

Somebody once asked, "Could I spare some change for gas?
I need to get myself away from this place."
I said "yep, what a concept?
I could use a little fuel myself.
And we could all use a little change."

Well, the years start comin' and they don't stop comin'.
Bed to the rules, and I hit the ground runnin'.
Didn't make sense not to live for fun.
Your brain gets smart but your head gets dumb.

So much to do, so much to see.
So what's wrong with takin' the back streets?
You'll never know if you don't go.
You'll never shine if you don't glow.

Hey now, you're an all-star, get your game on, go play.
Hey now, you're a rock star, get the show on, get paid.
And all that glitters is gold.
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

And all that glitters is gold.
Only shootin' stars break the mold.

Meaning: The singer has been told he is unprepared for the challenges of the world, and that he isn't very bright, and the person who told him 
this was telling him he was a loser via an "L" sign, although the singer describes this incident literally and thus might not have 
understood the significance of the symbol.

Despite this, the singer sings this song as a way of imparting his philosophy and life advice, some of which is reasonably sound. 
He observes that life involves a sequence of years that keeps on coming while you live. He observes we are "fed to the rules" which
is a similar phrase to "fed to the wolves", which seems to signify the world is full of rules governing our behavior that we have
to live with. He observes there is a lot to do and see in this world. There is "take life by the horns" style advice, suggesting 
he hit the ground running. The general gist of the all-star/rock-star ideas suggest doing what you are good at and taking the 
benefits of that, and suggests you'll never be good at things unless you try.

On the flip side, the singer has some problematic beliefs. He believes all that glitters is gold, so he may prefer the shiny to the 
substantial. He believes only shooting stars break the mold, but shooting star are ephemeral and die quickly. Some of the advice is 
questionable. He prefers to live for fun, saying otherwise you get book-smart but not street-smart. He prefers the main 
streets to the back streets, seemingly because it seems like a more showy path.

The singer likes it when his world's on fire (so he isn't bored), which could mean a preference for drama or the showy. The
question is posed whether the listener's world is on fire. Maybe when you're world's on fire that can be a motivating factor
in becoming a better person.

Verses: 
1. One sequence of verses discusses climate. The singer thinks the world will get colder, with the media claiming the world 
will get warmer. It references a "hole" in the satellite picture, which most straightforwardly refers to the ozone hole, which is a 
climate issue but doesn't really related to a warming/cooling world. The climate discussion is consistent with late 1990s 
climate science where a global cooling forecast had given way to a global warming forecast (with less ice and warmer water). The
singer offers some flip advice for a warming world, suggesting if the water is warmer that facilitates swimming.

2. Another verse pertains to someone asking him for change for gas, and the singer misinterprets the question literally, 
saying he could use some fuel and everybody can use some change. Perhaps the singer's lack of intelligence gets in the way of charity.

The general gist of the singer's message is to find what you're good at, go down paths that work at it, become an all-star or 
rock-star in it, and take the benefits. The singer's beliefs are incoherent enough that he may not have what it takes himself,
but on the other hand it is sung by a successful rock band, maybe the song isn't that far off what real rockers think. But even 
if the singer's self opinion is inflated or unreasonable, that doesn't mean the listener has to be similarly constrained. So I think 
the singer's message is still useful at face value. You don't have to be perfect to offer workable life advice, but you may have to
do as they say rather than do as they do.
