What's My Age Again? (Blink-182 [three members, 2 singers/guitarist, 1 drummer])
Released April 1999

(Start Song)
I took her out.
It was a Friday night.
I wore cologne
To get the feeling right.
We started making out.
And she took off my pants.
But then I turned on the TV.
And that's about the time she walked away from me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And are still more amused by TV shows.
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

But later on.
On the drive home.
I called her mom.
From a pay phone.
I said "I was the cops.
And your husband's in jail.
The State looks down on sodomy."
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And are still more amused by prank phone calls.
What the hell is caller ID?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And you still act like you're in freshman year.
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
That's about the time that she broke up with me.      What's my age again?
No one should take themselves so seriously.           Please stay with me.
With many years I had to fall in love.                Please stay with me.
Why would you wish down on me?                        Who? Stay with me.
I never want to act my age.                           Who? Stay with me.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Meaning: The singer is 23 years old, in college (per the "freshman" lyric), and a senior (the expected grade given his age). He is immature for his age in two relevant ways, specifically he is amused by TV shows and prank calls more than would be typically expected of a male his age. This is explained in the context of his romantic relationship with a girl (although the song does not reveal she is his girlfriend until the last verse).

Incident #1: He had a Friday night date, and he wore cologne which made him smell better (as experienced by both him and partner) and feel more comfortable. They were kissing and she took off his pants to initiate sexual activity. But instead of concentrating his energy on his girlfriend, he turned on the television. His girlfriend stopped the nascent sexual activity and accused him of having ADD (attention-deficit disorder).

Incident #2: While driving home from the date, the singer stopped at a pay phone to make a prank call to his girlfriend's mother. But the call's content was too malicious for a prank call, falsely pretending to be the police saying her husband is in jail for breaking laws against sodomy (homosexual activity). He called the woman a bitch after she hung up on him. This incident strains credulity which is justified by the odd lyric "What the hell is caller ID"? It's understandable the singer might not be familiar with caller ID, it was a newer phone technology in 1999. But caller ID has limited relevance from a pay phone call, it's more likely the recipient would have recognized his voice.

After these incidents the girlfriend broke up with him. There are backup vocal lyrics indicating there was a subsequent conversation whether to rekindle the relationship ("[Please] stay with me" said four times). With the flagrantly malicious incident #2 it is implausible any such conversation would happened. The opposite vocals contain parts of the conversation said by the singer.

"No one should take themselves so seriously." Perhaps the singer thinks the girlfriend takes herself too seriously.
"With many years I had to fall in love." Twenty-three is very young for a human adult, particularly for males. It's also reasonble to expect the girlfriend is in college. Probably neither of them have have had a very long time to develop relationships, so perhaps this lyric is sarcasm.
"Why would you wish down on me?" This is probably an expression of hurt occurring after the girlfriend wished ill feelings toward him.
"I never want to act my age." Maybe the singer thinks his allegedly immmature behavior is not actually a problem, which could be a reasonable position to take. However the never here goes too far: sometimes you really do need to act in a mature fashion.

So what do we make of this? A lot of the song doesn't make sense given incident #2 as given. It's better to confabulate incident #2 into something consistent with the rest of the song - say a prank call that both partners were in on at the start, went a bit over line, got heated, and the singer referred to his girlfriend's mother as a bitch afterward.

Can the relationship be salvaged? It seems reasonable to expect the singer to be more attentive of the girlfriend during sexual activity. And maybe she could do a better job of recognizing that maybe he has ADD. And "walking away" is also not ideal behavior for helping a partner change undesirable behavior for the better. Similarly with the reimagined prank call, maybe prank calls are ok sometimes, but need to be conduct with more maturity and respect for who's on the other end. The post-breakup conversation contains a mixture of mature and less mature ideas. Maybe the singer is closer to acting his age than even he thinks.
