What's My Age Again? (Blink-182 [three members, 2 singers/guitarist, 1 drummer])

(Start Song)
I took her out.
It was a Friday night.
I wore cologne
To get the feeling right.
We started making out.
And she took off my pants.
But then I turned on the TV.
And that's about the time she walked away from me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And are still more amused by TV shows.
What the hell is ADD?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

But later on.
On the drive home.
I called her mom.
From a pay phone.
I said "I was the cops.
And your husband's in jail.
The State looks down on sodomy."
And that's about the time that bitch hung up on me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And are still more amused by prank phone calls.
What the hell is caller ID?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

And that's about the time she walked away from me.
Nobody likes you when you're 23.
And you still act like you're in freshman year.
What the hell is wrong with me?
My friends say I should act my age.
What's my age again?
That's about the time that she broke up with me.      What's my age again?
No one should take themselves so seriously.           Please stay with me.
With many years I had to fall in love.                Please stay with me.
Why would you wish down on me?                        Who? Stay with me.
I never want to act my age.                           Who? Stay with me.
What's my age again?
What's my age again?

What's my age again?

Meaning: The singer is 23 years old and a senior in college. He is immature for his age in several ways, which is explained in the context of his romantic relationship with a girl (although the song does not reveal she is his girlfriend until the last verse).

Incident #1: He had a Friday night date, and he wore cologne which made him smell better and feel more comfortable. They were kissing and she took off his pants to initiate sexual activity. But instead of concentrating his energy on his girlfriend, he turned on the television. His girlfriend stopped the nascent sexual activity, accused him of having ADD (attention-deficit disorder), and told him he wasn't acting his age.
Incident #2: While driving home from the date, the singer stopped at a pay phone to make a prank call to his girlfriend's mother. But the call's content was too malicious for a prank call, falsely pretending to be the police saying her husband is in jail for breaking laws against sodomy (homosexual activity). He called the woman a bitch after she hung up on him, not understanding the consequences of the "prank" call on her.

He's been accused of having ADD (attention deficit disorder), but he doesn't understand what that is.
