(Start Song)

Eliza: The life of the wife is ended by the knife.
Stewie (spoken): By George she's got it! By George she's got it! Now what ends her wretched life?
Eliza: The knife! The knife!
Stewie (spoken): And where's that bloody knife?
Eliza: In the wife! in the wife!
Eliza+Stewie: The life of the wife is ended by the knife!
Stewie (spoken): Bravo, Eliza!
Eliza+Stewie: The life of the wife is ended by the knife!

(End Song)

Meaning: The only meaningful lyric: "The life of the wife is ended by the knife!" indicates a female spouse dies
during a marriage, by means of knife-wound(s). It is unclear if this is suicide, accident, or homicide. If this
song has any profound meaning, it is an observation that in marriages, there may be suicidal or homicidal feelings,
and in general they can't be acted on. Of course this is a cartoon and therefore is free to follow the rules. But
even in "Family Guy" context, it isn't an actual marriage, it's just interplay involving Stewie (the foul-thinking
baby).
