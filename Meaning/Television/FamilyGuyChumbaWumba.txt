Chumba Wumba (Family Guy)

Pawtucket Pat's brewery doesn't have a wheelchair ramp, so although Joe Swanson gets in the brewery gates,
he can't participate in the tour. He gets a song to usher him out of the picture, similarly to how it is done to bad 
children in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Pawtucket Pat: I guess this is where you get off.
[Pawtucket Pat whistles]

(Start Song)

Chumba wumba gobblety goo.
Life isn't fair, it's sad but it's true.
Chumba wumba gobblety gee.
When your poor legs are stiff as a tree.

What do you do when you're stuck in a chair? [Subtitle: Chair]
Finding it hard to go up and down stairs? [Subtitle: Stairs]
What do you think of the one you call God?
Isn't his absence slightly odd?
Maybe he's forgotten you.

Chumba wumba gobblety gorse.
Count yourself lucky you're not a horse.
They would turn you into dog food.
Or to chumba wumba gobblety glue.

(End Song)

[Joe is pushed out passed the gates of the brewery and exits the story following the tour]

Meaning: The song makes observations of a disability preventing a human from being able to walk and thus unable to use
stairs. Much of the humor here is treating the disability as a character flaw, even though most people would consider 
being paralyzed in police officer duty as a character asset. And beyond that, it's treated as a Charlie and the
Chocolate Factory level flaw which merits ridicule and explusion from the story.

The song directly states the truism that life isn't fair and that fact can make people sad. The song also
references religious skepticism that can occur when pondering something very unfair like a permanent disability.

Charlie and the Chocolate Factory flaws are character defects in children that can be attributed to both parents and
child. Here the "flaw" is so far away from this that it renders the entire situation absurd.
