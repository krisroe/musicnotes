Boom Boom Boom Boom (Vengaboys)

Refrain #1:
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I want you in my room.
Let's spend the night together,
From now until forever.
Boom, boom, boom, boom
I wanna go boom, boom.
Let's spend the night together,
Together in my room.

Refrain #2:
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
This is what I wanna do
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
(Let's have some fun)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
One on one, just me and you
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

(Begin Song)

Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
(Vengaboys are back in town)
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh

If you're alone and you need a friend:
Someone to make you forget your problems.
Just come along, baby, take my hand.
I'll be your lover tonight.

(End Song)

Meaning: The song is a dance song, with punchy instrumentals, and some lyrics can be interpreted to refer to dance (This is what I wanna do, Let's have some fun,
One on one, just me and you, Everybody get on down). But the obvious deeper point is an invitation to sexual activity, such as the only verse that has
coherent lyrics, to be the listener's lover tonight. "Boom, boom" in this context is a euphemism for sexual activity, and the main refrain lyrics are also
in this vein (I want you in my room, Let's spend the night together, Together in my room).

This context can be taken as serious or silly depending on one's preferences. But one line in the refrain places awkwardly: "From now until forever".
That line hints at a more permanent relationship. But are we talking about meaningless casual sex here, or sex deepening a relationship, possibly in a
permanent fashion? The more meaningless the sex, the more awkward the interpretation gets. Perhaps the real lesson here is people have differing expectations
for what sex in a relationship means, and if there isn't some common ground on the relevance-sex-has-to-the-relationship, things are likely to end badly.
But for the song it adds some philosophical meat to an otherwise breezy EuroDance song.
