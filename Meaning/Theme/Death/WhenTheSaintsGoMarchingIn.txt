When the Saints Go Marching In (Negro Spiritual)

Oh, when the saints... (Oh, when the saints...)
Go marching in... (Go marching in...)
Oh, when the saints go marching in...
Oh, how I want to be in that number... (Yes I do!)
Oh, when the saints go marching in...

Meaning: A saint is a highly revered religious figure, whose beatification/canonization involves miracles accomplished 
using the saint's divine energy, with ascension to sainthood happening after the saint's death.

More colloquially, a saint be something more human-level, along the lines of someone more ethical than most.
This song has association with the city of New Orleans, whose professional football team is known as the Saints. The song
could be associated with a Mardi Gras parade, with "marching in" referring to marching in a parade. The Christian
denomination associated with New Orleans is Catholicism, with Mardi Gras happening just prior to Lent.

But, judging from verses beyond the first, the divine interpretation is the saints are marching on to heaven through
the Pearly Gates. The subsequent verses suggest this happens at the apocalypse (stars fall from the sky, sun refuses to shine, 
moon turns red with blood, [Gabriel's] trumpet sound, horsemen begin to ride).

But why are the saints marching in at that point, presumably saints are already in heaven at the point of the apocalypse?
No religion would claim only saint-level people go to heaven. Catholicism asserts people go to heaven by the grace of God,
affected by baptism, good works, faith, and Jesus Christ. By that standard many people who go to heaven cannot be 
considered even colloquial saints.

I resolve this question by saying the song stretches the concept of "saints" to all the faithful. Anyone who gets to heaven must
have been saint-like in some meaningful way, even if small, and the singer of the song believes they will have done enough to get 
there.
