The Bum Bum Song (Tom Green)

(Start Song)

My bum is on the rail!
Bum is on the rail!
Look at me, my bum is on the rail!
My bum is on the man!
Bum is on the man!
It's a lot-of-fun to put your bum on a man!
My bum is on the step!
Bum is on the step!
Don't fall down the step, you might hurt your bum!

And that's not very fun,
If you fall down and hurt your bum.
I like to put my bum on things.
It's fun for everyone.

My bum is on the cheese!
Bum is on the cheese!
If I get lucky, I'll get a disease!
My bum is on the Swedish! (street sign with the word Swedish)
Swedish! Swedish! Swedish!

My bum is on the gum!
Bum is on the gum!
I can blow a bubble with my bum bum bum!
My bum is on the ship!
The battleship!
I hope they don't shoot the cannon in my bum!
Shoot poo all over he place!
Poo poo!

Cuz that isn't very fun,
When they shoot a cannon in your bum.
I like to put my bum on things.
It's fun for everyone.

My bum is on the dog.
My bum is on the cat.
My bum is on the phone.
My bum is all alone.

The rail is all alone.
The man is all alone.
The Swedish is all alone.
My bum is all alone.

One, two, three, four.

My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!
My bum is all alone!

Get the poo off my bum! (Get the poo off!)
I need the poo off my bum!
I gotta get the poo off my bum! (Poo poo!)

I wanna hear the cannon!
No! Let me hear the cannon! [loon sound]
No! No! No! No, not the loon!

Bum is alone!
Bum is alone!
Bum is alone!
Bum is alone!

I wanna hear the cannon! [loon sound]
I wanna hear the cannon! [loon sound] Not the loon!

[cannon sound]
Yeah! The cannon!
Now get the poo off my bum!
I want the poo off my bum bum!

Can I hear the loon again?
[loon sound]

Tom Green was an MTV personality in the 1990's pushing boundaries for what was allowable on television. This song combines
a rap style with poop humor, and intentionally makes no sense. The use of "Swedish" for a road sign with the word "Swedish"
is particularly memorable.
