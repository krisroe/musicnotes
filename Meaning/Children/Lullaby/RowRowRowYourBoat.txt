Row, row, row your boat (lullaby)

Row, row, row your boat,
gently down the stream.
Merrily, merrily, merrily, merrily.
Life is but a dream.

Meaning: The listener is in a boat in a stream, and the singer tells the listener to carefully navigate through the stream. 
This song is a lullaby, and the boat's journey analogizes to the listener navigating from wakefulness to sleep. The four
merrilies indicate this is a happy process, intended to guide the listener toward happy dreams. Dreams do not occur immediately,
instead there is a transition process from wakefulness to sleep to (hopefully pleasant) dreams, all covered in the short song.

The literal meaning of "life is but a dream" is a metaphysical claim that life is a dream. This is true for the level of
consciousness present in dreams, but is not correct in the reality of the awake state. But at a higher level of metaphysical
understanding, maybe it is possible for some part of life to be a dream. But that level of metaphysical understanding is 
presumably not present in a lullaby sung to a small child.
