Rainbow Connection (Muppet Movie)
Lyrics and music by Paul Williams and Kenny Ascher

Why are there so many songs about rainbows,
and what's on the other side?
Rainbows are visions, but only illusions, and rainbows have nothing to hide.
So we've been told and some choose to believe it.
I know they're wrong, wait and see.
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.

Who said that every wish would be heard and answered,
when wished on the morning star?
Somebody though of that, and someone believed it.
Look what it's done so far.
What's so amazing that keeps us stargazing,
and what do we think we might see?
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me,
all of us under its spell, we know that it's probably magic.

Have you been half-asleep, and have you heard voices?
I've heard them calling my name.
Is this the sweet sound that calls the young sailor,
the voice might be one and the same.
I've heard it too many times to ignore it, it's something that I'm 'sposed to be.
Someday we'll find it, the rainbow connection, the lovers, the dreamers, and me.
La da da dee da da doo, la da da da da da doo.
