We Know the Way (Moana)
Song by Lin-Manuel Miranda, Opetaia Foa'i
Non-English Parts are in Tokelauan (Polynesian) language

Tatou tagata folau vala'auina
E le atui o le sami tele e o mai
La ava'e le lu'itau e lelei
Tapenapena

Aue, aue
Nuku i mua
Te manulele e tataki iei

Aue, aue
Te fenua te malie
Nae ko hakilia kaiga e

We read the wind and the sky when the sun is high.
We sail the length of the sea on the ocean breeze.
At night, we name ev'ry star, we know where we are.
We know who we are, who we are.

Aue, aue
We set a course to find:
A brand-new island everywhere we roam.
Aue, aue
We keep our island in our mind,
And when it's time to find home, we know the way.

Aue, aue
We are explorers reading ev'ry sign
We tell the stories of our elders in a never-ending chin.
Aue, aue
Te fenua te malie
Nae ko hakilia, we know the way.

Meaning: This song occurs as Moana and her tribe rediscover their roots as a seafaring people. The song reference
various concepts relevant to a seafaring tribe: looking to the wind and sky for weather clues,
looking to the stars to determine the present location. The traditions are passed down from generation to generation,
which was eventually lost when the tribe settled down on an island. But if they reclaim their seafaring heritage, 
they can find new island homes and return to previous island homes.
