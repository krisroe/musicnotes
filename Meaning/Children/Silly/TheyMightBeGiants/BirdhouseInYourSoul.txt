Birdhouse in your Soul (They Might Be Giants)

I'm your only friend,
I'm not your only friend,
But I'm a little glowing friend,
But really, I'm not actually your friend, but I am...

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch,
Who watches over you.
Make a little birdhouse in your soul
Not to put too fine a point on it,
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet,
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.

I have a secret to tell,
From my electrical well,
It's a simple message and I'm leaving out the whistles and bells.
So the room must listen to me
Filibuster vigilantly
My name is Blue Canary,
One note spelled L-I-T-E.
My story's infinite,
Like the Longines Symphonette, it doesn't rest.

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch,
Who watches over you.
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.
Not to put too fine a point on it,
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet,
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.

I'm your only friend,
I'm not your only friend,
But I'm a little glowing friend,
But really, I'm not actually your friend, but I am...

There's a picture opposite me,
Of my primitive ancestry,
Which stood on rocky shores and kept the beaches shipwreck-free.
Though I respect that a lot,
I'd be fired if that was my job,
After killing Jason off and countless screaming Argonauts.
Blue bird of friendliness,
Like guardian angels, it's always near.

Blue canary in the outlet by the light switch,
Who watches over you.
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.
Not to put too fine a point on it,
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet,
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.

While you're at it,
Keep the nightlight on inside the birdhouse in your soul.

Not to put too fine a point on it,
Say I'm the only bee in your bonnet,
Make a little birdhouse in your soul.

Meaning: The song makes a metaphysical claim that a person's soul is analogous to light and electronics (and electric 
lighting for both together). The song also posits there is room for a birdhouse in one's soul (to hold a personally 
significant bird). This combination makes it possible for a bird-shaped night light to reside in the soul.

The singer is a friendly blue canary-shaped night light who keeps a vigilant watch over the listener at night. The 
night light's name may be Blue Canary Lite. The night light claims its secret message is simple, but this is sarcasm 
as there are complex metaphysical concepts in play. The night light's room-level public communication is described as 
filibustering which also belies the simplicity. The night light requests a metaphorical place be made inside the 
listener's soul. And beyond that the night light wants a significant role in the listener's life (only bee in your 
bonnet), perhaps even to the extent that it be the listener's only friend. 

There is discussion analogizing the night light with a lighthouse. The night light considers the lighthouse to be an 
ancestor, both guiding people (for the lighthouse case in ships) at night. The night light acknowledges it would not 
be very effective as a lighthouse because it is too small, so it does not have epic mythological status, such as with 
Jason and the Argonauts and the quest for the Golden Fleece. But the night light can be a nearby human-scale guardian 
angel.

The Longines Symphonette reference is for a brand used for old-time continuous-play (i.e. not resting) music devices. 
It fits with the electronic device theme. Electronic devices and lights can last a long time as long as power is 
supplied, the song suggests their story is infinite which is overstatement.

Later in the song, the night light claims a night-light in the birdhouse in the listener's soul exists. At that point, 
the singer issues a directive to keep the night-light on in their soul. If one accepts the song's framing, the song 
has resulted in something luminous existing inside the listener's soul, and the listener has an obligation to keep the 
light on.
