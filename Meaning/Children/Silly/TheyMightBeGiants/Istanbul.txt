Istanbul (Not Constantinople) (They Might Be Giants)

Refrain #1:
So take me back to Constantinople.
No, you can't go back to Constantinople.
Been a long time gone, Constantinople,
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks. (slower second time)

Refrain #2:
Even old New York was once New Amsterdam.
Why'd they change it? I can't say.
People just liked it better that way.

(Start Song)

Istanbul was Constantinople,
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Been a long time gone, Constantinople.
Now a Turkish delight, on a moonlit night.

Every gal in Constantinople,
Lives in Istanbul, not Constantinople.
So if you've a date in Constantinople,
She'll be waiting in Istanbul.

[Refrain #2]

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo

[Refrain #2]

Istanbul was Constantinople,
Now it's Istanbul, not Constantinople.
Been a long time gone, Constantinople.
Why did Constantinople get the works?
That's nobody's business but the Turks.

Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo.

[Refrain #1]

Istanbul!

(End Song)

This song remarks on the phenomenon of cities changing their names, specifically....
1. Constantinople (Byzantine Empire name) changing to Istanbul (Turkish name) done by the modern state of Turkey (1923), name change officially in 1930,
although Istanbul was commonly used by the Turkish population for hundreds of years prior during the Ottoman era.
2. New Amsterdam (Dutch colony name) changing to New York (English colony name). This name change happened in the late 1600s due to British conquest
of a Dutch colony.

The name changes took place so long ago, and the new names are so established that it's hard to fathom any ambiguity in modern times. So the idea of having
confusion with a date over the name of the city is absurdly funny. It's also funny that the song expresses a lack of understanding why the name changes were
made, when it doesn't require a whole lot of history knowledge to see the reasons.

The song has some Turkish references ("nobody's business but the Turks" and "Turkish delight") to underscore that it was the Turks that made the change.

More generally, place names can be controversial among different groups of humans who prefer one name or another, for example when colonial names
are switched away from after colonial rule ends.
