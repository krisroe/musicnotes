Whistling in the Dark (They Might Be Giant)

Refrain:
There's only one thing that I know how to do well.
And I've often been told that you only can do what you know how to do well.
And that's be you.
Be what you're like.
Be like yourself.
And so I'm having a wonderful time but I'd rather be
Whistling in the dark.
Whistling in the dark.
Whistling in the dark.
Whistling in the dark.
Whistling in the dark.
Whistling in the dark.

(Start Song)

A woman came up me and said,
I'd like to poison your mind,
With wrong ideas that appeal to you
Though I am not unkind.

She looked me, I looked at something
Written across her scalp.
And these are the words that it faintly said,
As I tried to call for help.

[Refrain]

There's only one thing that I like, and that is
Whistling in the dark.

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

A man came up to me and said
I'd like to change your mind.
By hitting it with a rock, he said,
Though I am not unkind.

We laughed at his little joke,
And then I happily walked away,
And hit my head on the wall of the jail
Where the two of us live today.

[Refrain]

There's only one thing that I like, and that is
Whistling in the dark.

[Refrain]

Whistling, whistling
Whistling in the dark.

Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah
Ah ah ah ah

(End Song)

Meaning: This song centers around some flawed life advice for two ideas taken together:
1. Concentrate on things you do well (the song takes this an absurd step further and says only do things you do well)
2. Be yourself

The trouble with this combination is regardless of what you do, you are being yourself. And the reasoning can go further and say whatever you do,
you are good at being yourself. So "being yourself", while a good piece of advice for individuality, becomes problematic without some metric for what
one is trying to be good at.

The verses of the song discuss two problematic scenarios where this can be problematic:
1. A woman tries to poison the singer's mind with wrong but intuitive ideas. Her advice is not intentionally unkind, she believes she is being helpful. 
And it seems she is compelled to do this (the song philosophy is written on her scalp).
2. A man tries to change the singer's mind using violence, although this may be a bit of a joke. His advice is also not intentionally unkind, perhaps he
thinks the violence is justified for the greater good.

Both people are said to be whistling in the dark, which in this context means overconfidence in their own beliefs and persuasive ability. Although the 
singer describes very little about himself, the idea is repeated so often that it is clear whistling in the dark applies to the singer as well.

The part with the man describes both the singer and the man living in "jail". Although the man advocates some form of violence, this should not be
interpreted as referring to a physical jail. It is a metaphorical jail in which our minds reside, making it difficult to effectively persuade others or
be persuaded vis-a-vis another point of view. Whistling in the dark means retreating one's mind to self-reflection only. It's an easy and comforting place
to go. The question posed by the song is can we recognize whistling in the dark and escape from our mind's prison (at least sometimes)?
