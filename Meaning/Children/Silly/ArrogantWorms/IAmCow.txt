I am Cow (Arrogant Worms)

I am Cow! Hear me moo!
I weigh twice as much as you,
And I look good on the barbeque.
Yogurt, curd, cream cheese, and butter's
Made from liquid from my udders.
I am Cow, I am Cow, Hear me moo. (moo)

I am Cow, eating grass.
Methane gas comes out my ass,
And out my muzzle when I belch.
Oh, the ozone layer's thinner
From the outcome of my dinner.
I am Cow, I am Cow, I've got gas.

I am Cow, here I stand,
Far and wide upon this land,
And I am living everywhere.
From B.C. to Newfoundland,
You can squeeze my teats by hand.
I am Cow, I am Cow, I am Cow.
I am Cow, I am Cow, I am Cow!

Meaning:
This is a silly song which literally describes many aspect of the mammal species cow: large weight, tastiness of beef,
products made from cow's milk, smelly tendency to produce methane gas, and living across a wide range of Canada,
and the fact that you can milk a cow by manually manipulating their teats.

The B.C. to Newfoundland lyric is a reference to Canada where the Arrogant Worms hail from.

There is also a reference to the environmental issue of global warming (in later years it would be more commonly referred
to as climate change). Carbon dioxide is typically the greenhouse gas discussed in this context, but methane is also part
of the issue, and indeed is more powerful a greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide. Also adding to the joke is a link with
the ozone layer, which is not actually a greenhouse gas problem, that's more of an issue with substances like C.F.C.'s. My guess
is the songwriters put this "incorrect" fact in there as a way to draw attention to several issues impacting the environment.
